## 1. Uploading an excel sheet 

To start uploading clients from a spreadsheet navigate to "Upload" bar in the "Create Clients" section, choose a file and upload it. Once the file is uploaded next thing to do is to **allow the columns with client information you have in your spreadsheet to be read by the system**. You need to choose the relevant parameters in the drop-down menu that would match the column names in your excel sheet. In the example below, we only wanted to import address and name of the client:

![Upload constrains](../images/upload_constrains.png)

Click "Next" button to continue after picking all the parameters. 

## 2. Map your clients

Next, you will see a map layout with all the saved client locations which will look something like this:  

![Upload map](../images/upload_map.png)

Click "Next" button to continue the upload. 

**NOTE**: It will look like this if all read locations are relatively close, more further locations will make the map zoom out to capture all the locations

## 3. Check the data 

Before final client upload to the system you can view the information one last time in a form of a list to check if your excel was read properly. If that's the case - hit "Create" button and you're almost there.

## 4. Make any adjustment if needed

The clients have been successfully uploaded and now you can adjust the client list as you want. You can check the clients you want to do same actions with and hit "Actions" button at the top of the nativation bar and choose what needs to be done to all of them. Also, you can click on any particular client and manually change information in his profile.

Client icons appearance can be adjusted in order to specify the type of business or for own client categorization which is explained in section [adding a client](/clients/creating_clients.md).
